This package provides a way to find errors without writing any tests. For example when you setup an event handler which does not exist at all, notifies you.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require imanghafoori/laravel-self-test
```

## Usage

You can run:

``` php
php artisan check:event
```

- It does not matter how you are setting your event listener, in the `EventServiceProvider`, by `Event::listen` facade, by Subscriber class... or any other way. The error would be found . :)

``` php
php artisan check:gate
```

It check the validity of all the gates you have defined, making sure that they refer to a valid class and method.
